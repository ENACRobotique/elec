This board is made to control a robot using 3 motors or less at a current not exceding 3A for each motor.

It features a central teensy 3.5 (not included) and LMD18200 to drive the motors.

the other features are listed below (subject to modifications):

- VCC voltage regulator
- I2C ports (ENAC Robotique standard)
- UART port (ENAC Robotique standard)
- UART port designed to hold a bluetooth module
- dynamixel ports
- dynamixel voltage regulator
- motor + encoder connectors
- pwm
- stepper drivers ?
- high power connector (for motors, dynamixels, ...)
- signal power connector

HCI & controls :

- connector for high power switching (to be connected with emergency stop button)
- connector for signal power switching
- connector for press or toggle button
- connector for mechanical encoder ? (Press + turning button like on the tester)
- connector for potentiometer
- connector and resistances for RBG led
- connector for departure device ("tirette")

Others :

- UART, I2C, analog pins and pwm female headers for supporting additionnal shield
- holes for fixation
